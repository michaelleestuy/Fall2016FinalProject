# Fall2016FinalProject
#Alex Lu + Michael Lee

Our project is an endless RPG Game, based in some dungeon run by Mr. Akhmedov. You choose one of three classes to explore the dungeon, and try and get as far as possible.
Our project's essential features are functional. You can select a class, select attacks, buy items, and attack enemies. Some small issues include balancing the game, and making it more skill based. Also, a timer more more readability, as well as placement of the displays would be beneficial to aesthetics.
Unresolved bugs-
-In certain places, entering something that is not prompted can crash the code
-Leveling up does not function
-Items do not seem to apply any stats
Just complie and run AkhmedovDungeon.java, instructions to use the program will be prompted within the program.
